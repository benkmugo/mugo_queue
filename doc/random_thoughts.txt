Random thoughts
===============

1) The limit parameter is important to have control over the iterations.
   It would be nice to have the task objects working with a limit but
   it's not safe to rely on it.
    
2) MultiThread needs the function init on task objects (this is not obvious)

3) Don't add dependencies to avoid deadlocks

4) Needs to gracefully handle edge cases like
   a) task cannot get executed anymore and therefore stays in queue forever
   b) any other edge cases?
   
5) Call TaskController - QueueDispatcher

6) Threadpoll size configured by Dispatcher but batch size configured by
   MugoTask
    
7) Event logging is random - hard to see what's happening

8) Take away the parameters from execute and have it set with a function
